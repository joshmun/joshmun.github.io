	<h1>An Introduction</h1>

	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	<p>The aim of this website is to share my passion for the electric guitar. On this site you'll be able to view my guitar of choice, as well as a few of my favorite pedals, why I chose them and how I approach them in shaping my tone.</p>
	<p>My <b>axe</b> of choice is the all <em>American Fender Deluxe Telecaster in Aged Cherry Burst.</em> Comes stock with N3 noiseless pickups, the Modern C fretboard is a delight, and the tuner locks keep me in tune for long sets.</p>

	<h3>The Amp</h3>
	<img src="images/bluesjr.jpg" alt="Blues Jr Amp" />
	<p>This is the Fender Blues Jr all tube amp. It's a classic choice, especially when paired against a Fender Telecaster. I was originally stuck choosing between a Blues Jr and a Vox AC15, but I ultimately chose the Blues Jr for 4 reasons.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Simplicity with an unchallenged clean sound.</li>
		<li>15 Watts is just the right headroom I need to start "breaking" in my smaller Church venues.</li>
		<li>Availability and budget - the Blues Jr I found to be more available at more reasonable prices than the coveted Vox AC15 CC with the coveted cream back celestion speaker cones.</li>
		<li>The "brightness" of the Telecaster is better paired with the darker Blues Jr in comparison to the "brighter" Vox AC15.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>But in your own guitaring journey, you may very well choose to pair your Tele with a Vox AC 15, and many do! But just as music is eclectic and myriad, so are the pedal paths, chains and combinations. When pursuing my pedal chain, I found the Blues Jr as a better match with my setup and tonal preferences.</p>
	<img src="images/amptop.png" alt="Amp top" />
	<p>Speaking of amp tone, I didn't mod my amp (at least yet...). I play for church where our setup is "mobile", as in we don't have a set building, and we often have to face playing limitations due to each venue. This basically means I can't crank up my master volume to 9 and achieve the "big box" tone. Here are three tips I use in achieving good, open and deep tone in a venue where you can't crank it up.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Crank the volume up before the master
			<ul>
				<li>One way I view the relationship of the two volume knobs is that the volume option will control how hard you hit the tubs, whereas the <b>Master Volume</b> will control the overall volume of what you create with the amp. You can actually control where you <em>break up</em> the gain and set that perfectly, then use the <b>Master Volume</b> to control how loud you can basically get away with in your venue. Of course, from my experience, the louder I can get the better-- simply because it allows for depth and openness in tone (versus the boxed in tone Blues Jr may be notorious for)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Bottom out, cut the tone
			<ul>
				<li>If you're like me, you're not playing with Hillsong United. In fact on my band, we're holding down the fort with a drummer, a praise lead (Acoustic and Vocals), and me the lone electric guitarist. While this is a ton of fun, there are a lot of tonal ranges that need to be filled in in my job-- and not just the higher end wailing solo registers, but the bottom ends as well.</li>
				<li>But cranking that Bass to 10 helps me achieve the depth in my tone I'm looking for in my clean tones. Pair that with a nice compressor, reverb, a solid low gain OD, and it's butter to your ears.</li>
				<li>One last note on this point is to cut the treble down to 4. I do this since the Telecaster is so bright anyways, it actually doesn't sound dull at all. This is totally preferential, and some may very well want the tone very up. But I found that if the tone is too high, it's a bit piercing to the ears. I want a nice warm, round, clean sound that I can achieve through the Telecaster. And when I want to bite the ears, I use the bridge pickup on the Tele for the treble boost.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Crank the Mid to 9
			<ul>
				<li>This is pretty self-explanitory. If you're looking for that "at-breakup" tone, then you need to boost your mids so that you <em>have</em> something to actually breakup. I learned the hard way that by cutting my mids (which in some contexts may work), you lose the crunchy bite that most people are looking for in there tone. So I boost this to work in tandem with the volume knob at 6 to achieve that <em>breakup</em> tone.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

	<h3>Pedals</h3>
	<p>A popular website I use to purchase used pedals, <em>that almost always is cheaper even when buying new since you can negotiate prices</em>, is <a href="https://reverb.com/">Reverb</a>.

	<a id="website"></a>
	<h3>Another Blog Post</h3>
	<p>An already existing <a href="https://reverb.com/news/the-gear-tones-and-techniques-of-modern-worship-guitar">website</a> that covers similar information, but in broader depth than this one, can be found <a href="https://reverb.com/news/the-gear-tones-and-techniques-of-modern-worship-guitar">here</a>.</p>
	<h4>The Good, the Bad, the Ugly</h4>
	<br>I think this website does the following well:
		<ul>
			<li>Dynamic and mobile optimized
				<p>The website adapts to fit whatever screen size I use to view the page.</p>
				<p>The navigation bar is beautiful and is dynamic. It has a sliding fadeaway animation as you scroll down the page.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Centered and beautiful
				<p>The content remains centered and adapts to multiple screen sizes.</p>
			</li>
			<li>I like how they represent the pictures of pedals as a one row table, and each picture is a link to a different part of the website.
				<p>I looked into the code for this section and realized that they have a separate CSS document helping them to style it. In that CSS document, they lay out the floats and pads--all of which I am super excited to learn next week!</p>
			</li>
			<li>Freezed search bars
				<p>I'm glad they freezed the search bar at the top so that people could search for pedals as they read this content, and that they hid the navigation bar.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
