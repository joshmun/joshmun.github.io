        <p>
          In the final week of Bootcamp, my team decided to build an HTML5 mobile application adaptable across multiple devices. In the short 7 days, we utilized agile methodologies, learned a brand new Phaser framework and deployed Cornman and the Cornman API both to heroku.

  <h1>Phase 1: Learn</h1>
      <p>The first objective was to learn. None of us had ever developed a game, but we approached the problem methodically, systematically and strategically.</p>
      <p>The first day was devoted to deep diving the subject. We scourged the internet for resources, found possibilities and closed doors. By lunch we circled in our chairs and decided: Pure Javascript, Phaser framework. We busted out our stickies and got to work towards a path to green. By the end of that first day we built our Kanban, forecasted project timelines and agreed that mandatory starbucks outings were a must on team norms-- the team was stoked.</p>

    <div class="phase-2">
      <p>The next few days began the iteration cycle. We pushed back and forth on various topics: whether to deploy pure javascript for our game, deploying a back end rails api only, then tearing it down in favor of a full rails application to both house top Cornman global scores and host our project website.</p>
      <p>As much as we coded, we designed full time. Every asset was original, rescaled and produced utilizing Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Aseprite. This was the highlight of the project. We could marry our passion for coding with our first love for design.</p>
      <p>This phase of the project best exemplified our greatest asset earned while at bootcamp. It was a demonstration of our ability to learn and tackle new challenges. We became comfortable with feeling lost and confused, and in that environment we thrived. We deep dived into Phaser, indexed reliable resources and learned to write and translate Javascript into ES6.</p>

        <h2>Lessons</h2>
        <p>Continue to challenge ourselves, such as implementing a username feature. Tackle scaling first.</p>
        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>Almostt everything in this game was originally created by the three of us. No corns were harmed in the making of this game.</p>
        <h2>Deploy</h2>
        <p>We successfully deployed the front end Cornman game to Heroku, as well as the Cornman API housing the database and its website. Deployment to Google Play store coming soon...</p>
